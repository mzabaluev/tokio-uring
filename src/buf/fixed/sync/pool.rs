//! A thread-safe, dynamic collection of I/O buffers pre-registered with the kernel.
//!
//! This module provides [`FixedBufPool`], a collection that implements
//! dynamic management of sets of interchangeable memory buffers
//! registered with the kernel for `io-uring` operations. Asynchronous
//! rotation of the buffers shared by multiple tasks is also supported
//! by `FixedBufPool`.

/// A thread-safe, dynamic collection of I/O buffers pre-registered with the kernel.
///
/// `FixedBufPool` allows the application to manage a collection of buffers
/// allocated in memory, that can be registered in the current `tokio-uring`
/// context using the [`register`] method. Unlike [`FixedBufRegistry`],
/// individual buffers are not retrieved by index; instead, an available
/// buffer matching a specified capacity can be retrieved with the [`try_next`]
/// method. In asynchronous contexts, the [`next`] method can be used to wait
/// until such a buffer becomes available.
/// This allows some flexibility in managing sets of buffers with
/// different capacity tiers. The need to maintain lists of free buffers,
/// however, imposes additional runtime overhead.
///
/// A `FixedBufPool` value is a lightweight handle for a collection of
/// allocated buffers. Cloning of a `FixedBufPool` creates a new reference to
/// the same collection of buffers.
///
/// Unlike [`FixedBufPool`][non-threadsafe] in the parent module, this
/// collection's handle is safe to use in multiple threads.
/// The application should take care to register the buffers in each thread's
/// runtime where I/O operations specifically using these buffers' handles
/// (e.g. `read_fixed` or `write_fixed`) will be used. It's also possible
/// to use the handles as regular buffers with other `tokio-uring` operations,
/// however in these cases the performance benefits of buffer registration
/// will not be realized.
///
/// The buffers of the collection are not deallocated until:
/// - all `FixedBufPool` references to the collection have been dropped;
/// - all [`FixedBuf`] handles to individual buffers in the collection have
///   been dropped, including the buffer handles owned by any I/O operations
///   in flight;
/// - All `tokio-uring` runtimes the buffers are registered with have terminated
///   and their [`Runtime`] instances have been dropped.
